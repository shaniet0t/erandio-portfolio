# Hello, I'm Erandio

I'm a passionate web developer and creative coder building clean, responsive, and user-friendly websites. I enjoy turning ideas into reality through code and design â€” whether itâ€™s front-end interfaces, interactive projects, or database-driven apps.

Currently sharpening my skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and SQL â€” always learning, always building.
